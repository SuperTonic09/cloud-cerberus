### Coding Exercise: Staff Security Engineer

This sample project aims to demostrate how to validate a given set of controls on a system —using Python.

# Cloud Cerberus
Often referred to as the Hound of Hades, Cerberus is multi-headed dog that safeguards the gates of the Underworld; In this case, he serves as inspiration to protect our resources residing on three of the well known cloud providers: AWS, AZ, GCP.

## Environment 
For this proof of concept, we will be evaluating the following environment(s):
- Microsoft Azure _(details TBD)_

## Controls
The NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-210, [General Access Control Guidance for Cloud Systems](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-210/final), served as the primary guide for this assigment —as it represents the initial step toward understanding security challenges in cloud systems, analyzing the access control (AC) considerations in all three cloud service delivery models—Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

## Usage
`python3 cerberus.py`
